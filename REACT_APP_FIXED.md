# React Application Fixed

## Issue Resolution
Fixed the module loading conflict by using only the built application bundle instead of mixing compiled and raw TypeScript modules.

## Changes Made
1. **Removed conflicting script tags** - Eliminated the raw TypeScript module loader
2. **Used built application** - Copied the properly built dist/index.html to public/
3. **Fixed asset serving** - Configured Hapi.js to serve /assets/ directory correctly
4. **SQL Server integration** - Maintained working backend with SQL Server connection

## Current Configuration
- **Frontend**: Built React application served from public/
- **Backend**: Hapi.js with SQL Server database connection
- **Assets**: JavaScript bundle served from /assets/index-B5Qt9EMX.js
- **API**: All endpoints working on /api/* paths

## Test URLs
- Main app: http://localhost:5000/
- API health: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- Jobs API: http://localhost:5000/api/jobs

The freelancing platform should now load correctly with the React frontend connecting to the SQL Server backend.
