# Database Connection Fix for Production âœ…

## Issue Identified:
Database name contains trailing space: `"freelancing_platform "` instead of `"freelancing_platform"`

## Solution Implemented:
1. **URL Cleaning**: Trim whitespace from DATABASE_URL
2. **URL Parsing**: Parse and reconstruct connection string properly
3. **SSL Configuration**: Added SSL support with `rejectUnauthorized: false` for development/self-signed certificates
4. **Fallback Handling**: Dual connection attempt strategy
5. **Better Logging**: Show actual database name being connected to

## Changes Made:
- Enhanced database connection logic in `server/database.js`
- Added URL sanitization and reconstruction
- Implemented fallback connection strategy
- Added SSL configuration for production environments

## Production Deployment Tips:
1. Ensure DATABASE_URL has no trailing spaces
2. Database name should be exactly: `freelancing_platform` (no spaces)
3. SSL certificates properly configured on production server
4. Connection string format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`

This fix handles common production deployment issues with PostgreSQL connections.
