# Server Testing Steps

## Current Status
I've created a minimal server version to eliminate plugin registration issues.

## What Changed
1. **Removed complex plugin registration**: No more Inert or Vision plugins that could cause startup issues
2. **Simplified to basic endpoints**: Only essential API routes
3. **Fixed async initialization**: Proper plugin registration order

## Test Files Available:
- `server/index.js` - Current minimal server (active)
- `server/index-minimal.js` - Backup of minimal version
- `server/index-full.js` - Full-featured server with database
- `server/index-clean.js` - Clean version without auth
- `server/index-backup.js` - Original server with auth issues

## To Test:
1. Deploy with current minimal server
2. Test `/api/test` endpoint
3. If working, gradually add features from full server

## Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "API is working correctly",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-19T17:30:00.000Z",
  "server": "Node.js Hapi",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Next Steps if Successful:
1. Add database connection back
2. Add more API endpoints
3. Add static file serving
4. Configure authentication

The minimal server should eliminate the plugin registration error and allow IIS to start the application successfully.
