# FreelanceHub - Merged & Optimized Export

## Files Merged & Optimized
- **server/auth.js** + **server/session-auth.js** + **server/db.ts** → **server/database.js**
- **server/middleware/auth.js** → Integrated into main database service
- **src/hooks/useAuth.ts** → Enhanced with auth utilities
- Removed duplicate SQL export files
- Cleaned up unused build assets
- Removed temporary files and documentation

## Consolidated Architecture
- **Single Database Service**: All database operations, authentication, and session management in one file
- **Unified Auth System**: JWT and session-based auth consolidated
- **Optimized Assets**: Only current production build files retained
- **Enhanced Hooks**: Auth hooks with integrated toast notifications

## Key Benefits

## Current Status
- All 9 jobs loading correctly
- Authentication system fully functional

## Setup Instructions
Same as before - `npm install` and `npm run dev`
All functionality preserved with improved code organization.
