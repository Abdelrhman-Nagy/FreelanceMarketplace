# Centralized Data Architecture - SQL Server Integration

## Architecture Overview

Created a unified data service layer that connects both the API endpoints and React webapp to SQL Server as the single source of truth.

### Database Service Layer (`server/database.js`)

**Centralized Connection Management:**
- Single SQL Server connection pool for all operations
- Automatic connection retry and error handling
- Connection status monitoring and health checks
- Graceful degradation for development environments

**Data Operations:**
- `getJobs()` - Fetches all active jobs with client information
- `getJobById(id)` - Retrieves specific job with detailed client data
- `getUserStats(userId)` - Gets user dashboard statistics from database
- `testConnection()` - Health check for database connectivity

**Data Processing:**
- Consistent JSON parsing for skills arrays
- Budget calculation logic for fixed/hourly rates
- Client information joining from users table
- Proper data type handling and formatting

### API Endpoints Updated

**Jobs API (`/api/jobs`)**:
- Now queries SQL Server through database service
- Returns enriched job data with client information
- Handles database errors gracefully
- Consistent response format

**Job Detail API (`/api/jobs/{id}`)**:
- New endpoint for individual job details
- Includes client ratings, company, and job history
- 404 handling for non-existent jobs
- Rich job information for detail pages

**User Stats API (`/api/my-stats`)**:
- Pulls real user statistics from database
- Calculates active jobs, proposals, contracts
- Database-driven dashboard metrics
- Error handling for missing users

**Health Check API (`/api/health`)**:
- Tests actual SQL Server connectivity
- Reports database status and errors
- Connection diagnostics for deployment

### React Frontend Integration

**Job Detail Page Enhanced:**
- Updated to use new job detail API
- Displays client information from database
- Shows client ratings and job history
- Handles missing data gracefully

**Data Flow:**
1. React components make API calls
2. API endpoints use database service
3. Database service connects to SQL Server
4. Data flows back through the same path
5. Consistent error handling at all levels

## Benefits of Centralized Architecture

**Single Source of Truth:**
- All data comes from SQL Server database
- No mock data or fallback systems in production
- Consistent data across all application parts

**Error Handling:**
- Centralized database error management
- Graceful degradation for connection issues
- Detailed error reporting for debugging

**Performance:**
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Optimized SQL queries with joins
- Reduced database roundtrips

**Maintainability:**
- Single place to modify database logic
- Consistent data formatting across endpoints
- Easy to add new data operations

**Scalability:**
- Connection pool handles multiple requests
- Easy to add caching layer if needed
- Database operations can be optimized centrally

## Data Consistency

**Job Information:**
- Title, description, budget, skills from jobs table
- Client name, company, rating from users table
- Proposal count and status tracking
- Created/updated timestamps

**User Statistics:**
- Real job counts from database queries
- Active proposals and contracts
- Client vs freelancer specific metrics
- Historical data preservation

**Error States:**
- Consistent error response format
- HTTP status codes for different error types
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fallback behavior defined at service level

The freelancing platform now has a robust, centralized data architecture with SQL Server as the authoritative data source for both APIs and the React frontend.
