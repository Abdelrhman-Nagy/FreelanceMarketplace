# Registration with Auto-Login Fixed

## Issues Resolved:
1. Fixed HTTP 500 error in registration endpoint
2. Implemented automatic login after successful registration
3. Added automatic redirect to home page after registration
4. Fixed database field mapping issues

## Changes Made:

### Server Side (`server/index.js`):
- Fixed field mapping for `firstName`, `lastName`, `userType`
- Added session creation immediately after user registration
- Proper skills array handling with JSON stringification
- Added `createdAt` timestamp

### Frontend Side (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):
- Added automatic redirect to home page after successful registration
- User is automatically logged in after registration

## Registration Flow:
1. User submits registration form
2. Server creates user in database
3. Server automatically creates session (auto-login)
4. Frontend receives success response with user data
5. Frontend sets user in context
6. Frontend automatically redirects to home page

## Test Results:
- Registration endpoint working correctly (201 Created)
- Session cookies being set properly
- User data properly structured in response
- Auto-login functionality implemented

Users will now have a seamless registration experience with immediate access to the application.
