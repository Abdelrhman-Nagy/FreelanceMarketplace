# React Application Serving Fix

## Issue Fixed
The 404 error for main.tsx was caused by incorrect file serving configuration in Hapi.js.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed async/await error handling** in Hapi.js file serving
2. **Copied React source files** to public directory for proper serving
3. **Updated route handlers** to properly serve static files and React SPA

## Current Configuration
- React source files now in: `public/src/`
- Main HTML entry point: `public/index.html`
- Hapi.js serves files from `public/` directory
- API routes still work on `/api/*` paths

## Testing
- Main app: http://localhost:5000/
- React main.tsx: http://localhost:5000/src/main.tsx
- API health: http://localhost:5000/api/health

The React application should now load properly without 404 errors for main.tsx.
