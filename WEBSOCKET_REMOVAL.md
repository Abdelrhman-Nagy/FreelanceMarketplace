# WebSocket Feature Removal - Complete ✅

## Changes Made:
1. **Database Configuration**: Removed WebSocket constructor from Neon config
2. **Import Cleanup**: Removed `ws` import and `neonConfig` WebSocket setup
3. **Server Simplification**: Pure HTTP API server without WebSocket complexity

## Removed Code:
- `import ws from "ws"`
- `neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws`
- WebSocket connection logic

## Current Status:
- ✅ Server running stable without WebSocket dependencies
- ✅ Database connectivity maintained and working
- ✅ All API endpoints functioning correctly
- ✅ Simplified server architecture for IIS deployment

## Benefits:
- Reduced complexity for IIS deployment
- Lower memory usage
- Simplified debugging
- Better compatibility with various hosting environments
- Faster startup time

## API Endpoints Still Working:
- GET /api/test - Server health check
- GET /api/jobs - Job listings (6 real jobs from database)
- GET /api/jobs/{id} - Individual job details
- GET /api/projects - Project listings
- GET /api/proposals - Proposal listings

Your FreelancingPlatform now runs as a pure REST API without WebSocket overhead.
